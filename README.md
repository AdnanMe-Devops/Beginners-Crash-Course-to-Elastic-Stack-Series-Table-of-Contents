# Beginners-Crash-Course-to-Elastic-Stack-Series

Welcome to the Beginner's Crash Course to the Elastic Stack Series!

In life, we are always in search of something. Whether we are in search of the meaning of life or the most delicious tacos in town, we heavily rely on search engines to get the answers.

You may already use apps such as Yelp, Uber, or Wikipedia on a daily basis. But did you know that these apps were built with Elasticsearch?

Elasticsearch is known as the heart of the Elastic Stack, which consists of Beats, Logstash, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. The Elastic Stack allows us to take data from any source, in any format, then search, analyze, and visualize it in real time.

If you are a developer who is looking to make data usable in real time and at scale, the Elastic Stack is a great tool to have on your belt.

## Who is this series for?

This series is open to all **developers** with little to no experience with the Elastic Stack or those who could use a refresher.

By the end of the series, you will be able to identify which products of the Elastic Stack would best serve your use case and know how to get started with these products.
